# chatgpt-retrieval-js

A simple script that enables you to use ChatGPT with your own files for question-answering tasks.

## Installation

```
npm install
```
Modify `.env.dist` to use your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and rename it to `.env`.

Place your own files (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.md`) in the `data/` folder.

## Example usage

To start the script, run the following command:

```
> npm run start
```

Feel free to customize and enhance the code to suit your specific use-case and data requirements. Happy ChatGPT interaction!
